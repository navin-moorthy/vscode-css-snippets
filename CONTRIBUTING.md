### Development

#### What's in the folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
- `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of each
  snippet file and specifies the language of the snippets
  `contributes.snippets`.
- `snippets/` - the folder containing all snippets.

#### Creating new snippets

- New snippets can be created by following the first 3 steps from
  [here](#quick-contribution-details)
- You can utilize
  [snippet variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables)
  to enable interactivity within you snippets
- Check
  [`snippets/breakpoints.json`](https://github.com/navin-moorthy/vscode-css-snippets/blob/master/snippets/contributions/snippet.json)

#### Test your snippets locally

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
- Verify that your snippets are proposed on intellisense.

#### Make changes and reload

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to
  the files listed above.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your
  extension to load your changes.
